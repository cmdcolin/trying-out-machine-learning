# Inference Architectures: CPU vs WebGPU

This project demonstrates two different ways to run the same neural network in the browser.

## 1. Native TypeScript (CPU)

Found in `packages/core/src/index.ts`.

- **Approach**: Traditional JavaScript arrays and nested for-loops.
- **Complexity**: $O(N \cdot M)$ for each layer (where $N$ and $M$ are neurons per layer).
- **Pros**: Zero dependencies, runs anywhere, very simple to understand.
- **Cons**: Slower for large networks, as it uses a single CPU thread and does not leverage SIMD hardware as effectively as a compiled engine.

### Math Logic
The CPU engine manually iterates through rows and columns of the weight matrix to perform matrix-vector multiplication ($Wx + b$).

## 2. WebGPU-Accelerated (GPU)

Found in `packages/webgpu/src/index.ts`.

- **Approach**: Compute Shaders written in **WGSL** (WebGPU Shading Language).
- **Parallelism**: Every neuron's output in a given layer is calculated **simultaneously** on a separate GPU thread (workgroup).
- **Pros**: Massive performance gains for wide layers (like our 1024-neuron layer).
- **Cons**: High initial complexity (requires shader compilation, buffer management, and memory synchronization).

### How it works:
1. **Buffers**: Parameters (weights and biases) are loaded onto the GPU memory into specialized **storage buffers**.
2. **Pipelines**: A "Compute Pipeline" is created using the WGSL shader.
3. **Dispatch**: The CPU tells the GPU: "Start 64 workgroups and run the shader."
4. **Mapping**: After the GPU is done, the final 10-neuron output is "mapped" back to CPU-accessible memory to read the result.
